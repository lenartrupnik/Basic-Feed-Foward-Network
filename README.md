# Introduction

We implemented basic feed neural network without using any common libraries like PyTorch/TensorFlow. To further improve our results we included L2 regularization and learning rate decay.

## Data
Our implementation was tested on [Cifar-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) on which we managed to get around 52% percision.
